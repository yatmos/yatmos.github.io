#### Abstract
Prior to the Neolithic Revolution around 12 000 Yr BP,
the Earth’s population was around 4 million hunter
gatherers. Population grew to around 1 Billion at the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the UK
(1750-1800). Thereafter, its growth began to accelerate
and population is now over 7.6 Billion with more
than 50% living in megacities or urban agglomerations,
known as Major Population Centres. The energy to fuel
this growth has been in large produced from fossil fuel
combustion. It has resulted in improved longevity, a
rapidly increasing standard of living, supplied by an
evolving industrial sectors. However, this has resulted
in ever increasing and evolving emissions of pollutants
(both short lived climate pollutants and long lived
greenhouse gases) and global land use change This is
impacting on air and water quality, human health,
ecosystem services and climate change. Pollution extends
form the local to global scale. The world has now
entered a new geological epoch the Anthropocene. To
assess accurately the impact of man in the evolving
Anthropocene both space based an airborne measurement
of atmospheric composition are a pre requisite.
The SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption
spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartographY) project
was proposed in 1988 to meet this need. SCIAMACHY
flew on the ESA Envisat (2002 to 2012), which flew in
a sun synchronous polar orbit in descending node, having an equator crossing time of 10:00 am local
time. SCIAMACHY, a passive remote sensing double
monochrometer, measured the up-welling radiation
from the top of the atmosphere. The GOME (Global
Ozone Monitoring Experiment) was a smaller version of
SCIAMACHY, on ESA ERS-2 (1995 to 2011) viewing
only in nadir. GOME-2 is a somewhat improved version
of GOME, aboard the ESA/EUMESAT. SCIAMACHY,
GOME, and GOME-2 are best known for the
retrievals of trace gases in the troposphere and the
stratosphere, where measurements of the total and
tropospheric columns of the trace gases O3, NO2,
HCHO, CHO.CHO, BrO, IO, H2O, CO as well ocean
colour, cloud and aerosol optical properties. In addition,
SCIAMACHY observations made the first dry
column mixing ratios of CO, CH4 and CO2.
In addition to space measurements, aircraft are
needed to provide high spatial resolution measurements
of trace atmospheric constituents to test our understanding
of the transport and transformation of atmospheric
emissions. EMeRGe (Effect of MEgacities on
the Transport and Transformation of Pollutants on the
Regional to Global Scales) was proposed to exploit the
capabilities of the German HALO research aircraft to
study the outflow from MPC. This presentation will
provide highlights from both spaced based remote
sensing and provisional observations from EMeRGe,
which is currently ongoing.
