#### Abstract
Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in weather and climate by effecting to atmospheric
variables via evapotranspiration. For example, the near-surface air temperature can change by
evapotranspiration of surface and root zone soil moisture. Therefore, its correlation with the near
surface temperature is usually considered as an effective indicator of the coupling strength
between land surface and the atmosphere (Seneviratne et al., 2013) . Especially, soil moisture
anomaly in dry regime has been reported as a main cause of the strong land-atmosphere coupling
able to trigger droughts and heat waves (Miralles et al., 2011) . Soil moisture also influences
precipitation formation and storm tracks via its coupling with the atmosphere (Santanello et al.,
2019 ) . Consequently, inaccurate SM in the land-surface-model initialization hinders us from
better predictions of extreme climate and weather because of unrealistic land-atmosphere
interactions through uncertainties in air temperature, moisture, dynamics, cloud formation and
precipitation. Therefore, the data assimilation (DA) of global soil moisture estimation from
remote sensing measurements becomes more and more critical in weather and climate prediction.
In this seminar, I would like to introduce new microwave radiative transfer model (RTM)
required in DA system improved by considering variability of soil organic matter and vegetation
scattering albedo. As a result, the improved RTM can provide more accurate soil moisture
estimation from SMAP brightness temperature with uncertainty information to DA system. Soil
organic matter (SOM) plays also a critical role for the parametrization for surface run-off,
infiltration, evapotranspiration and soil respiration in hydrological modeling. It means that more
accurate estimates of SOM from remote sensing measurements will allow us to predict more
realistic SM and ST ultimately effecting on surface air temperature and relating weather and
climate events. We are the novel RTM capable of capturing the unrecognized global variability
of SOM with well synchronized with SM from SMAP microwave brightness, which will be key
in proper reflection of hydrological impact on climate prediction model. In this seminar, I will
provide a preliminary result about whether it is possible to estimate not only soil moisture, but
also soil SOM simultaneous from microwave.
