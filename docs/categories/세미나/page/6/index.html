#### Abstract
Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in weather and climate by effecting to atmospheric
variables via evapotranspiration. For example, the near-surface air temperature can change by
evapotranspiration of surface and root zone soil moisture. Therefore, its correlation with the near
surface temperature is usually considered as an effective indicator of the coupling strength
between land surface and the atmosphere (Seneviratne et al., 2013) . Especially, soil moisture
anomaly in dry regime has been reported as a main cause of the strong land-atmosphere coupling
able to trigger droughts and heat waves (Miralles et al., 2011) . Soil moisture also influences
precipitation formation and storm tracks via its coupling with the atmosphere (Santanello et al.,
2019 ) . Consequently, inaccurate SM in the land-surface-model initialization hinders us from
better predictions of extreme climate and weather because of unrealistic land-atmosphere
interactions through uncertainties in air temperature, moisture, dynamics, cloud formation and
precipitation. Therefore, the data assimilation (DA) of global soil moisture estimation from
remote sensing measurements becomes more and more critical in weather and climate prediction.
In this seminar, I would like to introduce new microwave radiative transfer model (RTM)
required in DA system improved by considering variability of soil organic matter and vegetation
scattering albedo. As a result, the improved RTM can provide more accurate soil moisture
estimation from SMAP brightness temperature with uncertainty information to DA system. Soil
organic matter (SOM) plays also a critical role for the parametrization for surface run-off,
infiltration, evapotranspiration and soil respiration in hydrological modeling. It means that more
accurate estimates of SOM from remote sensing measurements will allow us to predict more
realistic SM and ST ultimately effecting on surface air temperature and relating weather and
climate events. We are the novel RTM capable of capturing the unrecognized global variability
of SOM with well synchronized with SM from SMAP microwave brightness, which will be key
in proper reflection of hydrological impact on climate prediction model. In this seminar, I will
provide a preliminary result about whether it is possible to estimate not only soil moisture, but
also soil SOM simultaneous from microwave.</p>

#### Abstract
The recent emergence of unmanned aerial system (UAS) and urban air mobility (UAM), the new
frontiers in air transportation operating in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), is expanding
the scope of aviation turbulence forecasting system from ensemble-mean to eddy-resolving
forecasts (Muñoz-Esparza et al. 2018). Despite its tangible benefits, operational turbulence-
resolving forecasting at scales of 10-100 m is not quite feasible yet due to its high computational
costs, and resolving urban landscapes at scales of 1 m for UAM applications poses additional
challenges. This study investigates the impact of urban landscapes on low-level turbulence and
associated turbulence hazards to UAM operations, based on ideal- and real-case building-
resolving simulations using the GPU-accelerated FastEddy® large-eddy simulation (LES) model
(Sauer and Muñoz-Esparza 2020) with explicit representation of building effects by an immersed
body force method (Muñoz-Esparza et al. 2020).
<p>We first explore the interactions between urban landscapes and ABLs, using idealized building-
resolving LESs of the flow around isolated cuboid buildings to variations in the incoming
turbulence arising from changes in ABL stability. 21 building-resolving simulations are
performed under varying ABL stability conditions, from weakly stable to convective ABLs, and
for different building sizes (H), resulting in L<sub>ABL</sub> /H ≈ 0.1 – 10, where L<sub>ABL</sub> is the integral length
scale of the incoming ABL turbulence. The building-induced flow features observed in the
canonical neutral ABL simulation, e.g., the upstream horseshoe vortex and the downstream arch
vortex, gradually weaken with increasing surface-driven convective instability due to the
enhancement of background turbulent mixing. By considering the ABL turbulence scale and
building size altogether, it is shown that the building impact on the surrounding flow decreases
with increasing L<sub>ABL</sub> /H, as coherent turbulent structures (e.g., near-surface streaks, convective
rolls and open cells) in the ABL become more dominant over building-induced flow response for
L<sub>ABL</sub> /H &gt; 1.</p></p>

#### Abstract
Understanding the global distribution of atmospheric black carbon (BC) is essential to unveil its
climatic effect, but there are still large uncertainties regarding the simulation of BC transport due to
inadequate information about emission rates and removal process. To assess the (1) bottom-up emission
inventories and (2) wet removal scheme in FLEXible PARTicle model (FLEXPART version 10.4), the
black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) ratios were investigated from long-term (2010 to 2016),
harmonized observations under different conditions (affected and unaffected by wet deposition) at four
sites in East Asia, including two sites in Korea (Baengnyeong and Gosan) and two sites in Japan (Noto
and Fukuoka). First, by excluding wet deposition effects based on accumulated precipitation along
trajectory (APT), the measured ΔBC/ΔCO ratios were used to validate the Regional Emission inventory
in ASia (REAS) version 2.1. The BC/CO ratios from the REAS emission inventory (7.7 ng m −3 ppb −1 for
East China – 23.2 ng m −3 ppb −1 for South Korea) were overestimated by factors of 1.1 for East China to
3.0 for South Korea, whereas the ratio for North Korea (3.7 ng m −3 ppb −1 from REAS) was underestimated
by a factor of 2.0, most likely due to inaccurate emissions from the road transportation sector. The
overestimation in Seoul, the southwestern regions of South Korea, and Northeast China was noticeable,
and underestimation was mainly observed in the western regions in North Korea, including Pyongyang.
Second, according to the relationship between APT and transport efficiency (TE; the ratio of
ΔBC/ΔCO affected and unaffected by APT), the wet removal efficiency was lower in East and North
China but higher in South Korea and Japan, implying the importance of the aging process and frequency
of exposure to below- and in-cloud scavenging conditions during airmass transport. Moreover, the wet
scavenging in winter and summer showed the highest and lowest efficiency, respectively, although the
lowest removal efficiency in summer was primarily associated with a reduced BC aging process because
the in-cloud scavenging condition was dominant. By comparing TE from the FLEXPART, we found that
the scavenging coefficients of the below- and in-cloud calculated by following the FLEXPART scheme
were slightly overestimated by a factor of 1.7 and highly underestimated by 1 order of magnitude
compared to the measured values, respectively. Using artificial neural networks, the convective available
potential energy, which is well known as an indicator of vertical instability, should be considered in the
in-cloud scavenging process to improve the representative regional difference in BC wet scavenging over
East Asia. This study suggested an effective and straightforward evaluation method for bottom-up
emission inventories and wet scavenging schemes for BC by introducing ΔBC/ΔCO ratio and APT.</p>

#### Abstract
The ability to obtain accurate emission estimates of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has been
highlighted as an important issue for many decades, not only for regulating local air quality
but also for assessing national-scale air quality and climate concerns. In particular, urban
emissions need to be well-understood because approximately 70% of anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emissions originate from urban areas. Emission of carbon dioxide (CO2)
and methane (CH4) and the meteorological factors affecting them using an aircraft
equipped with a cavity ring-down greenhouse gas sensor as part of the Alpha Jet
Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX) project flights in a cylindrical pattern was estimated over
Sacramento, California. To better constrain the emission fluxes, we designed flights in a
cylindrical pattern and computed the emission fluxes from two flights using a kriging
method and Gauss’s divergence theorem. Differences in wind treatment and assumptions
about background concentrations affect the emission estimates by a factor of 1.5 to 7.
The uncertainty is also impacted by meteorological conditions and distance from the
emission sources. The total flux estimates accounting for the entire circumference are
larger than those based solely on measurements made in the downwind region. This
indicates that a closed-shape flight profile can better contain total emissions relative to a
one-sided curtain flight because most cities have more than a point source and wind
direction can change with time and altitude. To reduce the uncertainty of the emission
estimate, it is important that the sampling strategy account not only for known source
locations but also possible unidentified sources around the city.
Other than CO2 and CH4 emission estimates study, the recent studies regarding
long-range ozone transport and extreme precipitation events (e.g. atmospheric rivers) are
also briefly introduced.</p>

#### Abstract
We are now conducting new Asian hydroclimatological project, the Asian Precipitation
Experiment (AsiaPEX), which is the successor of the GAME and the MAHASRI projects
under the GHP/GEWEX/WCRP leading the joint activity of the Asian hydroclimatological
research community. The objectives of the AsiaPEX are defined as &quot;understanding of Asian
land precipitation over diverse hydroclimatological conditions and multiple time scales for
better prediction, disaster reduction, and sustainable development.&quot; The AsiaPEX does not
pursue a geographical region-oriented strategy, but a research approach-oriented strategy,
which focuses on 1) observation and estimation of variation and extremes in Asian land
precipitation, 2) process studies of Asian land precipitation focusing on diverse land-
atmosphere coupling, 3) understanding and prediction of the variability of Asian monsoon
from subseasonal to interdecadal time scales, 4) high-resolution land surface hydrological
modeling and monitoring incorporating impacts of human activities, 5) coordinated
observation and modeling initiatives, 6) detection and projection of the climate change
impact on regional precipitation in Asia. Recent development of the AsiaPEX activity will be
reviewed briefly.
The impact of the climate change is one of the key research targets of AsiaPEX because of
the acceleration of the global warming in recent decades. It is our mission to clarify the
future change of the Asian hydroclimatological system, which has huge impact on the
people in Asia. For this purpose, climate models are important tool. Recent research on the
limitation of current climate models will be reviewed, to elucidate the difficulties and impacts
of reproduction of the monsoon onset process. I will review the research on the Asian
monsoon heating process and will propose yet another analysis method. It is based on the
mass conservation law of the upper tropospheric high potential temperature airmass, and
lower tropospheric high equivalent potential temperature airmass. A case study of the
evolution of Asian summer monsoon in 2017 showed an important role of the lower
tropospheric northward inflow over the Bay of Bengal, which causes active pre-monsoon
severe storms over the Bengal Plain. The relative role of the heating by the elevated land
surface over the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding convective activity will be discussed.</p>

#### Abstract
인위적 탄소 배출량의 증가로 인한 대기 CO2 농도 상승은 지구온난화를 가속화시킬 뿐만 아니라
폭염, 가뭄과 같은 극한 기상 현상을 심화시키며 인류와 생태계에 막대한 피해를 주고 있다.
효율적으로 기후변화 대응방안을 모색하고 정확히 미래 기후변화를 전망하기 위해서는 기후변화의
주원인인 대기 CO2가 어디서, 어떤 과정으로 인해 배출/흡수되는지, 즉 전 지구 탄소 순환을 먼저
이해할 필요가 있다. 육상생태계와 해양은 인위적으로 배출된 전체 탄소의 약 절반을 흡수해 대기
CO2 농도의 상승을 억제하는 역할을 하고있다. 이들은 기후 및 환경변화에 민감하게 반응하므로
주요 탄소 흡수원으로의 이들의 역할이 앞으로 어떻게 변할지를 이해하기 위해서는 현재
육상생태계와 해양 탄소 플럭스의 시공간 변동에 대한 연구가 필수적이다. 하지만 다양한
자연생태계의 구조와 직접 관측망의 공간적 한계로 넓은 지역에서의 탄소 플럭스의 변동을
이해하는데 많은 어려움이 있다. 이에 대한 방안으로서 모든 탄소 배출/흡수원의 시공간 변동을
반영하는 대기 CO2 농도를 지역 혹은 전 지구 규모에서의 자연적 탄소 흡수원의 변화를 보는
진단자로서 활용하는 연구가 널리 수행되고 있다. 특히 계절 변화가 뚜렷한 중/고위도 지역에서는
대기 CO2 농도의 계절 변동성의 변화를 통해 자연생태계의 광합성과 호흡 및 해양의 CO2 용해도
변화 등의 물리/생화학적 과정들을 이해하기 위한 연구가 활발히 진행 중이다. 이 세미나에서는 먼저
전 지구 규모에서 대기 CO2 농도의 계절 변동성의 공간적 특성 그 원인을 소개하고, 계절 변동성의
장기 추세 분석을 통해 알 수 있는 북반구 중/고위도의 육상 생태계 탄소 순환과 남극해의 해양 탄소
순환의 변화를 소개하고자 한다.</p>

#### Abstract
<p>기후변화로 인한 이상기후 발생은 환경에 대 한 全 세계적인 관심사로 자리잡았다.
세계경제포럼(World Economic Forum, WEF)은 &lsquo;2020 세계 위험 보고서‘에서 ’ 20년대
발생가능성이 높은 문제로 1위를 기상이변으로 꼽았고 이후 기후변화 대응 실패, 자연재해,
생물다양성 손실, 인간유발 환경재난 순으로 정리하였다. 그렇다면 기후변화를 유발하는 것으로
인식되는 기업들은 어떤 노력을 하고 있는지 살펴보자. 글로벌 기업들은 더 이상 환경부문을 경영과
별개의 분야로 보지 않고 환경경영 체제로 전환하여 환경을 기업의 핵심가치로 다루고 있다. 예를
들어, ‘애플’은 환경을 6대 경영가치에 포함하여 최적의 친환경 프로그램을 발굴하여 추진하고
있으며, CEO 팀쿡은 재생에너지 전환에 대한 신념을 공개 표명하여 사업 경쟁력 강화에 활용하고
있다. 또 하나의 예로, 도브 등 다수의 유명 생활제품 브랜드를 가진 ‘유니레버’는 CEO 직속으로
지속가능 팀을 구성, 플라스틱 포장재를 자사 판매량 이상 수거 및 재활용한다는 목표를 가지고 활동
중이다. 이러한 목표는 글로벌 기업의 공통된 경영이념으로 기업들은 재생에너지 100% 사용을 위한
RE100 이니셔티브에 가입하고 있는 추세다. 그중 구글, 마이크로소프트 등은 이미 재생에너지 100%
전환을 달성하였으며, 인텔 역시 ‘30년 재생에너지 100% 전환 목표를 발표하였다. 우리 정부 역시
재생에너지 확대 사용을 위한 신재생에너지법 시행령 개정안을 입법예고 하였다. 국내는 아직까지
재생에너지 공급의 불안정 등을 해결하기 위한 세부 사항에 대한 추가 논의가 필요하지만 국내
기업은 지금부터 적극적인 준비가 필요하다. 결국 기업의 기후변화에 대한 여러가지 대응노력은
글로벌 경쟁력 확보뿐만 아니라 미래에 지속가능한 기업으로 남을 유일한 해법이다.</p></p>

#### Abstract
<p>In recent decades, climate modeling studies have shown that the proper representation of the stratospheric circulation in models is required to reliably simulate the tropospheric climate and variability on seasonal to longer-time scales. Current-day global models include the mesosphere in their domains to fully resolve the stratospheric circulation, thereby demanding realistic parameterization of subgrid-scale (mesoscale) gravity waves, a key process that controls the middle atmospheric circulation. Traditionally, all existing gravity wave parameterizations have commonly been using several underlying assumptions to efficiently describe the wave processes. One of such assumptions is to diagnose the processes as if the waves reach the model top instantaneously once they are generated in the troposphere. This so-called steady-state assumption does not allow the waves to experience temporal variations of the background flow and to timely exchange their momentum with the flow. Given that it takes several hours to days for the waves to travel to the mesosphere, it is required to assess the reality of this assumption. In this talk, a prognostic model of gravity waves, which has recently been developed to simulate the transient propagation of waves, will be introduced, and the effect of the transient dynamics will be presented using this model as a subgrid-scale parameterization in the German operational atmosphere model (ICON). We focus particularly on the intermittency of simulated gravity waves and its comparison to the observations as well as on the modeled middle atmospheric circulation. In addition, a new finding of interaction between gravity waves and large-scale equatorial waves in the stratosphere, simulated using the same model, will be reported.</p></p>

#### Abstract
<p>Large-scale atmospheric circulation has been represented mostly by interaction between the mean flow and planetary waves (PWs), not only in the troposphere but in the middle atmosphere (stratosphere and mesosphere) as well. Although the importance of gravity waves (GWs) has been recognized for long time, contribution of GWs to the large-scale circulation is receiving more attention recently, with conjunction to GW drag (GWD) parameterizations for climate and global weather forecasting models that extend to the middle atmosphere. As magnitude of GWD increases with height significantly, circulations in the middle atmosphere are determined largely by interactions among the mean flow, PWs and GWs. Classical wave theory in the middle atmosphere has been represented mostly by the Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) equation, which include PW and GW forcing separately to the mean flow. Recently, however, increases number of studies revealed that forcing by combined PWs and GWs is the same, regardless of different PW and GW forcings, implying a compensation between PWs and GWs. There are two ways for GWs to influence on PWs: (i) changing the mean flow that either influences on waveguide of PWs or induces baroclinic/barotropic instabilities to generate in situ PWs, and (ii) generating PWs as a source of potential vorticity (PV) equation when axisymmetric components of GWD exist. The fist mechanism has been studies extensively recently associated with stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs) that are involved large amplitude PWs and GWD. The second mechanism represents more directly the relationship between PWs and GWs, although less attention has received, which is required to understand the dynamics in the middle atmosphere completely (among the mean flow, PWs and GWs). In the present seminar, a recently reported result (Song et al. 2020) of the generation of PWs by GWs associated with the strongest vortex split-type SSW event occurred in January 2009 is presented focusing on the second mechanism. In addition, some preliminary results of idealized GCM simulations are provided.</p></p>

#### Abstract
<p>Pronounced changes in the Arctic environment add a new potential driver of anomalous weather patterns in midlatitudes that affect billions of people. Recent studies of these Arctic/midlatitude weather linkages, however, state inconsistent conclusions. A source of uncertainty arises from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Thermodynamic forcing by a rapidly warming Arctic contributes to weather events through changing surface heat fluxes and large-scale temperature and pressure gradients. But internal shifts in atmospheric dynamics — the variability of the location, strength, and character of the jet stream, blocking, and stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) — obscure the direct causes and effects of linkages. It is important to understand these associated processes to help differentiate Arctic-forced variability from natural variability. Though complicated by intermittency and obfuscated by large natural variability in the extratropics, observational evidence for Arctic/midlatitude weather linkages continues to accumulate, along with understanding of connections with pre-existing climate states. Relative to natural atmospheric variability, sea-ice loss has so far played only a secondary role in Arctic/midlatitude weather linkages.</p></p>

#### Abstract
<p>장마의 기상학적 정의에 반드시 포함되는 것이 정체전선이다. 그렇기 때문에 정체전선의 구조와 위치를 파악하는 연구는 활발히 이루어져왔다. 현업 예보에서는 500hPa 지위고도의 5880gpm을 장마전선의 기준으로 사용해왔으며, 장마철 평균장을 이용한 연구에서는 상당온위의 남북 경도가 최대를 가지는 구역을 정체전선의 위치로 분석하였다. 하지만 지위고도를 이용하는 경우는 전반적인 정체전선의 북상 경향을 파악하는 것은 가능하지만 강수 영역과 일치하지 않는 한계를 보였으며, 상당온위를 이용한 정체전선의 분석은 기후 규모에서 기단의 특성을 이용한 설명에 가깝기 때문에 날씨 규모에서 강수 영역과 일치하지 않거나 정체전선 외의 경계면도 같이 나타낸다는 점에서 적용에 어려움을 보였다. 또한 장마철 강수의 개별 사례 분석을 통해 정체전선은 하나의 역학적 구조를 가지는 현상이 아니라 북태평양 고기압과 이동성 고기압의 경계면, 북태평양 고기압과 이동성 종관 저기압의 경계면, 북태평양 고기압 가장자리를 따라 이동하는 종관 또는 중규모 저기압들의 경로로 나타난다는 점을 확인할 수 있었다. 이에 본 연구에서는 다양한 구조를 가지는 정체전선을 설명하기 위하여 공통적인 요인인 북태평양 고기압 가장자리를 역학적으로 정의하고, 그 변동성을 살펴보았다. 정체전선은 북태평양 고기압의 가장자리에 서로 다른 요인들이 부딪혀 경계면을 발생시킨다는 점과, 고기압의 가장자리는 중심에 비해 기압 경도가 크게 나타난다는 점에 착안하여 수평 바람장의 변형(deformation)이 경계면을 설명하고, 기압경도가 크게 나타나는 면이 북태평양 고기압의 가장자리를 설명할 수 있다는 점을 확인할 수 있었다. 장마를 역학적 특성에 근거하여 정의함으로써 여름철 강수 중 정체전선에 의한 강수를 구분해 낼 수 있으며, 개별 장마 강수 사례의 구조를 파악할 수 있었다.</p></p>

<p>고도 약 50km에서 1,000km에 이르는 넓은 영역에 걸쳐있는 지구 전리권(ionosphere)은 태양 복사선에 의해 대기 분자들이 이온화되어 있는 영역으로 고층대기(upper atmosphere)인 중간권과 열권에 걸쳐 있어 서로 영향을 주고받는다. 이곳은 지구와 우주를 나누는 경계로 1) 위로는 태양, 태양풍, 자기권과 같은 지구 바깥에서 오는 에너지, 2) 아래로는 대류권, 성층권과 같은 저층대기(lower atmosphere)에서 오는 영향을 받아 끊임없이 변화한다. 이러한 전리권/고층대기의 급격한 변화는 위성 운용, 위성 항법과 전파 통신의 성능을 크게 저하한다. 본 세미나에서는, 우주가 시작되는 곳인 지구 전리권/고층대기의 특성과 그 변화에 대해서 간략히 소개하고자 한다.</p></p>

#### Abstract
<p>The 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)
adopted Resolution 70/1, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. This Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and
prosperity. Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is the
greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for
sustainable development.
As a specialized agency of the United Nations, the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) contributes to the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 13 on climate action as
the co-custodian through the maintenance and expansion of its
Members&rsquo; atmospheric, oceanographic and land-based observational
networks, the free unrestricted exchange of the resulting data and
information and related capacity development and research in order
to optimize the production of weather, climate and waterrelated
services worldwide.
The WMO community&rsquo;s challenge is to provide decision-makers with
the scientific facts and analyses they need to adapt to climate change
impacts and build climate resilience. In addition to hosting the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the World
Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the Global Climate
Observing System (GCOS), WMO is promoting international action
and cooperation on climate change. WMO’s Contribution to SDG-13
is based on the results-based framework and mechanism through
the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), the Climate
Services Information System and the Multi-Hazard Early Warning
System. The contribution of WMO to the SDGs will be introduced.</p></p>

#### Abstract
<p>Marine phytoplankton can produce gaseous dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which is the most abundant form of sulfur released into the atmosphere through sea–air gas exchange. The polar oceans are known to be the most productive ocean in terms of DMS due to the high abundance of DMS-producing phytoplankton. The oceanic emission of DMS into the marine atmosphere has received increasing attention during the last 30 years because of its possible contribution to cloud formation and its subsequent impact on climate. However, the climate role of DMS remains largely unknown because of lack of evidence supporting DMS-derived formation of aerosol particles and their subsequent activation into cloud condensation  uclei (CCN). The Arctic and Antarctic Oceans are facing drastic regional warming, thereby, these regions undergo rapid environmental changes (i.e., increasing temperature, acidification, sea-ice decline, shallowing mixed layer depth). These changes may cumulatively have cascading effects on biogenic DMS emissions and sulfur aerosol formation. We recorded and analyzed the atmospheric DMS mixing ratios at Arctic (Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard; 78.5°N,11.8°E) and Antarctic (King Sejong Station; 62.1oS, 58.5oW) sites during phytoplankton bloom periods and found varying regional relationships between the atmospheric DMS and the extent of exposure of the air mass to the phytoplankton biomass in the ocean  surrounding the observation site. Furthermore, the connection between biogenic DMS and the formation of aerosol particles in the Arctic and Antarctic atmosphere was evaluated by analyzing atmospheric DMS mixing ratios, aerosol particle size distribution, aerosol chemical composition and satellite-derived estimates for oceanic biological characteristics data. The results indicate that oceanic DMS emissions could play a key role in the formation and growth of aerosol particles. Moreover, the taxonomic composition of marine phytoplankton could affect the formation of DMS-derived new particles in the Arctic and Antarctic atmosphere.</p></p>

#### Abstract
<p>항공난류는 주요 항행 위험 요소로, 항공기에 직접 영향을 끼치는 약 10-1,000 m 규모의 대기 중 요란으로 정의된다. 상층 전선과 제트류, 산악이 유도한 대기 흐름, 대류운 등을 원인으로 발생하는 항공난류는 승객과 승무원의 부상, 비행 연착, 연료 손실 및 기체 손상 등 항공 운항에 부정적 영향을 미치고, 그로 인한 경제적 손실은 매년 수십억 원에 달한다. 이 같은 피해를 최소화하기 위해서는 난류 발생 과정을 이해하고, 이를 정확히 예측하는 것이 항공 분야의 중요한 과제라 할 수 있다. 이러한 노력의 일환으로 한국, 미국, 영국은 민·학·관의 상호 협력을 바탕으로 현업 수치 예보 모델과 항공난류 관측 자료를 활용하여 항공난류 예측 시스템을 개발하였고, 이 시스템은 각국의 기상청에서 현업 운용되고 있다. 그러나 이 시스템은 상층 전선 및 제트류와 관련한 난류 진단 지수들로 구성되어 있으므로, 대류가 유도한 난류 발생의 진단 능력은 상당히 떨어지는 실정이다. 대류가 유도한 난류는 구름 내부에서 발생하는 난류와 구름 외부에서 발생하는 난류(Near cloud turbulence, 이하 NCT)로 분류된다. 구름 내부 난류는 위성 사진과 비행기 탑재 레이더로 구름 경계를 사전에 파악할 수 있어, 이로 인한 피해가 작은 편이다. 반면, NCT는 청천 대기에서 발생하기 때문에 육안으로 식별하기 어려워 구름 내부 난류와 비교하면 그로 인한 피해가 큰 편이다. 그렇기 때문에 NCT에 대한 연구의 필요성이 강조되어 왔고, 관측 및 수치 실험을 활용한 여러 NCT 발생 메커니즘 분석 연구가 선행되었다. 그 결과 NCT가 대류 중력파의 전파와 깨짐, 대류에 의해 유도된 바람 시어의 강화, 대기 흐름 변형 등 다양한 요인으로 발생하며, 특히 대류 중력파가 NCT 발생과 긴밀한 연계성을 가지고 있음이 확인되었다. 이와 관련하여 본 세미나에서는 Chun and Baik (1998)이 제안한 대류 중력파 항력 모수화 방안을 바탕으로 한 NCT 지수의 개발, 고해상도 수치 실험 결과를 이용한 NCT 지수의 효용성 평가, 1년(2016년 12월 – 2017년 11월) 기간의 기상청 전지구 예보 모델 자료와 전지구 항공난류 관측 자료를 이용한 NCT 지수의 예보 성능 검증에 관한 결과를 발표할 것이다.</p></p>

#### Abstract
<p>현재 진행되고 있는 지구 온도 상승은 인류가 지구에 출현한 이후 가장 빠르게 진행되고 있으며, 이는 인위적인 온실기체 방출에 의한 것임이 과학적으로 입증되었다. 무엇보다도 그 위기를 공감한 각국 정치인들은 2015년 파리 협정을 통하여 지구 평균온도 상승 폭을 산업화 이전 대비 2℃ 이하로 유지하고, 더 나아가 온도 상승 폭을 1.5℃ 이하로 제한하기 위해 함께 노력하기로 합의를 했다. 이 같은 고무적인 행동은 미국의 파리 협정 탈퇴 선언으로 퇴색되기는 했지만, 협정에 서약한 대부분의 나라들은 이를 실행하기 위한 노력을 경주 할 것으로 기대 된다. 하지만 화석연료 사용의 감축이라는 정치적/경제적 방향의 전환에 대한 실현 가능성은 차치하고, 보다 근본적으로 1.5℃/2℃ 이하로의 유지가 과연 과학적으로 실현 가능할 것인가에 대한 의문을 제기 할 수 있다. 이는 지구기후시스템이 선형적 시스템이라면, 온실기체의 증가 폭에 대한 기온의 증가 폭이 일정하게 유지될 것이고, 일정한 온실기체량을 유지함으로서 지구 기온도 유지될 것으로 기대 할 수 있다. 그러나, 지구기후시스템은 지극히 비선형적이기 때문에 그 반응은 단순한 비례관계가 될 수는 없다. 즉, 기후 변화의 임계점, 티핑 포인트가 발현된다면, 인류의 운명은 돌이킬 수 없는 급격한 기후 변화와 맞서게 될 것이다. 본 세미나에서는 티핑 포인트에 대한 이론과 그 예, 그리고 기후 모형 실험을 통하여 구한 지구 기후시스템의 비가역적 변화를 소개할 것입니다.</p></p>

#### Abstract
<p>2020년 1월 말, 중국과 한국을 포함한 동북아지역에서는 Coronavirus Disease의 급격한 감염 확산으로 사람들의 외부활동이 제한되었고, 인위적 배출 감소로 인한 PM2.5를 포함한 대기오염물질의 농도 감소가 확인되었다. 특히, 사람들의 활동이 본격적으로 제한되었던 2020년 2<del>3월은 중국과 한국에서 관측된 PM2.5 농도가 이전 3년간 (2016</del>2019년 2<del>3월) 평균 농도와 비교하여 각각 -16.8 ㎍/㎥, -9.9 ㎍/㎥ 감소하였다. 이러한 COVID-19 기간의 PM2.5 농도 감소에는 2010년 초반 이후 현재까지 지속적으로 추진하고 있는 배출저감정책의 영향과 기후변화와 관련된 동북아지역 기상 변동의 영향이 함께 포함되어 있다. 본 연구에서는 대기질 모사 결과와 관측농도를 이용하여 동북아지역 2020년 겨울의 PM2.5 농도 변화에서 기상의 영향을 먼저 분리하였고, 나머지 배출변화에 의한 영향 중 국가별 배출저감정책과 COVID-19의 영향을 구분하여 정량적으로 제시하였다. 중국과 한국의 2020년 2</del>3월에 관측된 PM2.5 농도의 감소에 대한 COVID-19의 영향은 각각 약 -16%, -21%로 나타났다. 이 기간 동안 기상변화와 배출저감정책에 의한 PM2.5 농도 영향은 각각 중국에서 -7%와 -8%, 한국에서 -5%, -4%로, COVID-19에 의한 인위적 배출량의 감소가 기상변화 및 배출저감정책의 효과보다 크게 작용함을 알 수 있었다.</p></p>

#### Abstract
<p>Particulate matter (PM) concentrations at a given location are determined by local emission and long-range transport(LRT) from neighboring areas, where local emission consists of direct emission as particles (solid) and indirect emission as precursors (gas) to form particles through chemical reactions in the atmosphere. COVID-19 has changed our life style drastically affecting social behavior, economy, industry, traffic etc., which in turn affected air quality as well. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) from GOCI and NO2 from OMI and TROPOMI showed noticeable changes in the air quality in East Asia. With the longer lifetime of aerosols as compared to NO2, the reduction of these two pollutants appeared differently. While aerosols are affected by LRT, i.e. meteorology, and NO2 reflects the changes in social behavior.
Furthermore, to assess the effects of transboundary transport of aerosols on air quality in Korea over long term, geostationary satellite measurements are used with back-trajectories using the NOAA HYSPLIT model. For LRT events, satellite observations showed high AOD plumes over the Yellow Sea, a pathway between Eastern China and South Korea, and the movements of aerosol plumes transported to South Korea were also detected. PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, and AOD during LRT increased by 52%, 49%, and 81%, respectively, relative to their average values for 2015–2018. To quantitatively characterize the LRT of aerosols, the effects of LRT on PM2.5 concentration categories were estimated. When high concentrations of PM2.5 were observed in Seoul, they were likely to be associated with LRT events.</p></p>

#### Abstract
<p>-묘목, 개체목, 그리고 임분의 단계별 영향-
<br>
대기 중 온실가스 농도의 증가로 인한 기후변화는 지구 온난화를 일으키고, 대기 중의 포화수증기량을 기하급수적으로 증가시켜, 가뭄, 홍수와 같은 기상재해의 빈도와 강도를 증가시킬 것으로 예상된다. 우리나라에서도 가뭄의 빈도와 강도가 증가하고 있으며 특히, 봄 가뭄 발생 시 잎의 유무에 따라 산림 탄소 순환에 대한 가뭄의 영향이 달라질 수 있다. 이에 본 실험실에서는 가뭄에 따른 우리나라 산림생태계의 변화를 예측하기 위해, 다양한 강도의 가뭄하에서 대표 식재 수종 11개 종의 생리적 반응과 2014년에 시작된 가뭄이 2017년에 끝나기 까지 산림 개체목의 생장 그리고 상록침엽수림과 낙엽활엽수림의 수분과 탄소 수지의 변화를 관찰하였다. 개체목 단위의 형태적 생리적 변화를 간단히 보면 가뭄의 강도가 강해질수록 잎의 크기는 작아지고, 엽중량비는 증가하였으며, 기공전도도와 증산량 그리고 수분포텐셜이 감소하였다. 지난 2012년에 설치된 직경성장밴드를 이용하여 가뭄이 산림의 수종별 생산성에 미치는 영향의 경우, 졸참나무, 굴참나무, 까치박달은 강수량이 급격히 감소한 2014년에 생장량이 가장 많았으며, 이후에 감소하는 경향을 보였다. 하지만, 잣나무는 강수량보다는 일사량에 더 많은 영향을 받았으며, 생장시기에 광량이 많을수록 생장량이 커지는 경향을 보였다. 이와 더불어, 전나무, 갈참나무는 생장에 있어 지난해의 환경에 영향을 받는 것으로 나타났다. 임분 단위의 연구에서는 2015년부터 2018년까지 상록침엽수림인 잣나무(Pinus koraiensis)조림지와 참나무과 수종이 우점하고 있는 낙엽활엽수림에서 에디 공분산 방법으로 관측한 순생태계생산량(Net ecosystem production, NEP)을 이용하여 (1)서로 다른 가뭄 강도에 대한 두 임분의 NEP 변화와 (2)NEP 회복 지수(RC NEP)를 이용한 가뭄 이후 두 임분의 NEP 회복 차이를 확인하고, (3) 두 임분에서 차이가 발생한 원인을 분석하였다. 참나무 임분에서 겨울철(비생장기)을 제외한 연간 NEP는 가뭄 강도가 감소함에 따라 증가하는 경향을 보인 반면 잣나무 임분에서는 2015년이 아닌 2017년의 NEP가 가장 낮았다. 특히 다른 해의 같은 기간 보다 강수량이 크게 감소하였던 2016년 가을부터 2017년 봄 사이에 잣나무 임분의 증발산과 수관차단강수로 2017년 봄 가뭄 기간에 토양수분함량이 토양의 위조점 아래로 감소하였으며, 이로 인해 잣나무 임분에서 기공을 닫고 광합성량이 크게 감소한 것으로 나타났다. 또한 극심한 수분스트레스의 legacy effect때문에 가뭄이 종료된 후에도 NEP의 회복이 느리게 진행되는 것으로 생각된다. 향후 산림의 가뭄 피해가 증가할 것으로 예측되는 가운데, 본 실험실의 연구 결과와 같이 묘목, 개체목 그리고 임분 단위의 가뭄에 대한 반응을 고려한 산림관리가 이루어져야 할 것으로 생각된다.</p></p>
